                    <p>
                        Cats are popular companion animals, known for their independent nature and soft fur.
                         They are relatively small, typically weighing between 8 and 11 pounds, and are obligate carnivores, meaning they need meat in their diet.
                          Cats are crepuscular, meaning they are most active during dawn and dusk. 
                          They are also known for their meticulous grooming habits, spending a great deal of time licking their fur clean.

                        Domestic cats (Felis catus) are descended from the North African/Southwest Asian wildcat (Felis silvestris lybica). 
                        This wildcat species is the common ancestor of all domestic cats, and their domestication is thought to have occurred in two main periods: the Fertile Crescent (Neolithic era) and ancient Egypt (Classical period). 
                        While there may have been other independent, but short-lived, domestication events, the descendants of the African wildcat are the ones that survived to become the modern domestic cat.
