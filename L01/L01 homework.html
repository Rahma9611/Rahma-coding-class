       My name is Rahma. <br>
       I am 14 years old. My birthday is on the 9th of June. <br>
       I go to Mesaieed international school. My favourite subjects are math, english and geography. <br>
       I like these subjects because I am good at them which makes them easy and fun to study and understand. <br>
       I have started to learn how to code to help develop apps that help people. I even have a few ideas in mind right now. <br>
       I crochet and workout when I have free time. It makes me happy and calms me down.<br>
